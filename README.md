# True Salary Story React

## Introduction

Originally developed as a collaborative effort with team members during a Node.js course in 2023, this project was built using Nuxt.js 3. Sebsequently, I revamped the project to Next.js 13 on my own to gain familiarity with the React ecosystem, which I had not previously used at work.

The project focuses on a salary-sharing platform inspired by real-life examples. The main features implemented so far include:

- Google login for user authentication
- User profile
- Display of salary information
- [Submission feature enabling users to post salary-related content](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iekJwyLrvxvXSOFi_xU7iimMPjUg96ke/view?usp=sharing)
- [Order placement with Linepay payment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t_Up9NVzhY8CxmOfoKGV4MQv055mbWih/view?usp=sharing)

The techs I have utilized are:

- Next.js 13
- Typescript
- React Hook Form
- React Query
- Zustand
- TailwindCSS and Clsx

Note: The project is currently in progress and undergoing further development.
